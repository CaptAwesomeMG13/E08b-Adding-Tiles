# E08b-Adding-Tiles

In this project, I experement with lots of things in godot to work my way towards making a final product. The end 
goal is to make this look like the brickbreaker. Its a very basic version and will add more toward the end of these 
projects as I learn how to control godot more. Hope you enjoy this basic version.
